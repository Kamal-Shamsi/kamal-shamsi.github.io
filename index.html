                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bgs01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>My full name is Kamaluddin Shamsi. However, friends and family call me just Kamal.</p>
                <p>I am 25 years old, I was born in Afghanistan but raised in Russia. Majority of my life I have lived in Russia all the way up to after my graduation from highschool. I went to Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Computer
                    Science, but once I finished my first semester, I quit and shortly after that I moved to the United States.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bgs02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>The first time I started thinking about living in the US was when I was in 7th grade, it all started from Hollywood movies, then as I was getting older and understanding what I want from my life, I was seriously considering moving to the
                    United States.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bgs03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Some people have a hard time finding what they truly like, for me, it was a long search until I finally understood what I like to do and what I will be investing the majority of my time in the future. It was computer science, I have noticed
                    I have always been around computers and technologies. It all started from video games, but then it grew to interest in how everything is actually working.
                </p>
                <p>At the end of the highschool I had 2 plans:</p>
                <h4>A)Get into Russian university and make my career in Russia</h4>
                <h4>B)Move to the United States and do my best there, even if that means starting everything from scratch.</h4>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bgs04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>After my first semester at Moscow State University of Instrument Engineering and Computer Science, I knew I wanted to try the plan B. My destination was California,specifically silicon valley - the tech capital of the world.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bgs05.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>Today, I am a student at the University of California Santa Cruz. I am majoring in computer science, I am currently an intern in a Tech startup company and continuously working hard my way to the top.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/bgs06.jpg" alt="" /></span> My journey in the United States was tough and full of challenges, however, the person that I have become today is motivated, has a vision and goals. I’ve learned a lot
                of valuable lessons that I believe will help me to succeed in my life.

                <h2 class="major">Hobbies,projects and goals</h2>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Hobbies01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>I am interested in computer science and I noticed that the technology environment is dynamic. Whoever studies computer science-related majors or working in the field needs to be prepared for the rapid changes happening in the industry.
                    I stay aware of the challenges companies face and consistently read articles on how tech companies work. I am continuously developing my coding abilities and currently I am capable to work with following languages and platforms such
                    as: C,C++,C#, Assembly language,HTML,CSS and Javascript . My skills allowed me to make my own software. One of them is to automate the process of learning and make it more efficient.</p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Hobbies02.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>During this process, I sought out a senior developer as a mentor and he has provided guidance throughout my learning process. The idea came to me as I noticed that the productivity of students dramatically dropped and the amount of time
                    we spend in front of a screen increased since the national lockdown began. Thus, the app I created is designed to pop up on your screen every thirty minutes with a question and four multiple-choice answers on the topic you choose to
                    learn about. This application is user friendly. Due to its simplicity, the learning material would become easier to memorize which would encourage students to study the topic of their choice.
                </p>
                <span class="image main"><img src="images/Hobbies03.jpg" alt="" /></span>
                <p>My passion to solve everyday challenges has led me to experiment with my knowledge, find creative solutions, and grow as a developer.With technology expanding into every corner of human society, my creative problem-solving ability and
                    skills will allow me to overcome new challenges. As a student of UC Santa Cruz, I have seen the need for computer science during education. I hope after I finish my degree, I will be able to move on to working on solving major issues
                    that humanity is facing such as cyber security.Nearly 40% of WEF leaders cited cybersecurity as a “clear and present danger” to the global economy. Like pandemics, income inequality and extreme weather caused by climate change, cybersecurity
                    is a global problem. Working in a team, together we can make the world a better place for everyone.
